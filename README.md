# Bamazon-storefront
*Node.js &amp; MySQL Store*

Attempting to create an interactive storefront interfaced through node using MySQL to manage a "bamazon" database. 
The first objective is to create a product table (of unique id, name of product, department name, price for customer and stock quantity in store for each product) and populate it. 

``` javascript
              const MYSQL= require('./bamazon');
              const INQUIRER = require('inquirer');
```

..... in progress
